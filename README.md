### MorphologyAnalyzer

###### A morphological analyzer is proposed in the following paper:
### Sude Tavassoli, Sara Alipour, *A Morphological Analyser For Persian Adjectives and Nouns*, In the Proceedings of IEEE 2010 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering (ICACTE2010), vol. 5, pp. 437-440, Chengdu, China, 20-22 August, 2010.
###### The analyzer is modelled in the high-level declarative language lexc. The attached files in the project folder contain all the lexicons for persian adjectives.
